Source code for the tutorial 'Deploying a machine learning model with a Flask API' written for [HyperionDev](http://blog.hyperiondev.com).

Requirements: Flask, scikit-learn, numpy, scipy

In this tutorial we take the image classification model built in `model.py` which recognises Google Street View House Numbers. Using Flask to create an API, we can deploy this model and create a simple web page to load and classify new images.
